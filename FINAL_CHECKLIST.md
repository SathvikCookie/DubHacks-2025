## 🎯 Data Flow Verification

```
✅ User Prompt
    ↓
✅ Gemini API → JSON segments
    ↓
✅ POST /api/stories/generate
    ↓
✅ Story created (DB)
    ↓
✅ Loop through segments:
      ✅ Format text with emotion
      ✅ Call ElevenLabs API
      ✅ Save MP3 file
      ✅ Create AudioAsset record
    ↓
✅ Story marked as processed
    ↓
✅ Frontend GET /api/stories/<id>
    ↓
✅ Load audio segments
    ↓
✅ Play segment 0
    ↓
✅ On 'ended' → play segment 1
    ↓
✅ Continue until all segments played
```
