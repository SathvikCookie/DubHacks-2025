# ðŸ§ª Run Full End-to-End Test

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Start Flask Server

```bash
cd backend
python app.py
```

**Wait for:** `Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000`

### Step 2: Run Test (in another terminal)

```bash
cd backend
python test_with_mock_gemini.py
```

This will:
1. âœ… Create a story about Shriyan learning not to lie
2. âœ… Process 12 segments through ElevenLabs
3. âœ… Save 12 MP3 audio files
4. âœ… Store in database
5. âœ… Verify frontend accessibility

**Expected time:** ~30 seconds

### Step 3: View Results

The test will print:
- Story ID
- UUID
- Audio file locations
- Frontend URL to test

### Step 4: Test Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Then open the URL printed by the test (e.g., `http://localhost:3000/player/1`)

## What the Test Does

### Mock Story: "Shriyan and the Honest Rabbit"

**Prompt:** "write a story for my child about not lying. my kid's name is Shriyan. Use animal characters."

**Story Summary:**
- Shriyan eats Ruby the Rabbit's berries
- He lies about it
- Feels terrible
- Tells the truth
- Ruby forgives him
- They become better friends
- Moral: Honesty strengthens friendships

**Segments:** 12
**Emotions:** neutral, scared, sad, happy, excited
**Word count:** ~222 words

---

## Expected Output

```
âœ… Story Generated
   Title: Shriyan and the Honest Rabbit
   Segments: 12

âœ… Audio Processed
   Story ID: 1
   UUID: abc-123-def
   Audio Files: 12/12

âœ… Frontend Ready
   Story URL: http://localhost:3000/player/1
```

---

## Files Created

1. **generated_story.json** - Mock Gemini output
2. **processed_story.json** - Backend response with audio metadata
3. **audio_files/[uuid]_segment_*.mp3** - 12 audio files

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Flask server not running"
**Solution:** Start server in Step 1 first

### "403 Forbidden"
**Solution:** Restart Flask server (CORS fix applied)

### "Audio files not generated"
**Solution:** Check ELEVENLABS_API_KEY in .env

### "Gemini import error"
**Solution:** This test uses mock data, no Gemini needed

---

## Next: Test with Real Gemini

Once Gemini package is installed:

```bash
cd backend
python test_end_to_end.py
```

This will use real Gemini API with the same prompt.
